## COVID-19 Tracking CLI Tool

The COVID-19 Tracking CLI Tool is a Python and SQL-based Command-Line Interface (CLI) application designed to track COVID-19 data for different states in India. This data-driven tool utilizes the powerful pandas library to import and analyze COVID-19 data, allowing users to efficiently manage and track the information. By seamlessly connecting to an SQLite database, the tool offers comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for data management.

The project leverages the principles of functional programming to establish a seamless connection between Python and SQL. By employing the SQLite3 module, the application ensures efficient data retrieval and analysis. The integration of pandas further streamlines the process, enabling prompt display of relevant COVID-19 information on the CLI interface. This functional approach enhances the overall performance and usability of the tool.

One of the key features of this COVID-19 Tracking CLI Tool is its emphasis on user experience and visual representation. The application dynamically adapts to the user's terminal size by integrating various Python libraries, including os. This ensures accurate display of ASCII characters representing COVID-19 data, regardless of the terminal dimensions. The CLI nature of the tool offers a user-friendly interface that allows easy navigation and interactive CRUD operations. Users can visualize comprehensive insights on COVID-19 cases in different states of India, facilitating informed decision-making and analysis.
